## 🌍 Project Overview

The objective of the internship was to study **differential game theory** and apply it to ecological and economic modeling, particularly for the **sustainable exploitation of fishery resources**.

Key themes:

- ✅ **Optimal control** for single-resource users
- 🤝 **Differential games** modeling competition between multiple fishermen
- 🎯 **Nash equilibrium** strategies under resource dynamics

## 🧠 Mathematical Models

### 1. Optimal Control Problem

$$
\max_E \int_0^\infty (pqx(t) - c)E(t) e^{-\delta t} dt
$$

Subject to:

$$
\dot{x}(t) = rx(t) \left(1 - \frac{x(t)}{K} \right) - qE(t)x(t)
$$

### 2. Differential Game Problem (multi-player)

Each fisherman maximizes their profit while impacting the shared resource:

$$
\max_{E_i} \int_0^\infty (p_i q_i x(t) - c_i)E_i(t) e^{-\delta_i t} dt
$$

The competition is captured via **interconnected control dynamics**.

## ⚙️ Tools and Methods

- Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle for optimal control
- Derivation of **closed-form equilibrium strategies**
- Use of **Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman inequalities**
- Numerical simulation of biomass and harvesting trajectories

## 📈 Results

- Long-term behavior of fish biomass
- Comparison of exploitation strategies (solo vs competitive)
- Characterization of Nash equilibrium efforts
- Interpretation of sustainability and policy implications

---

## 🧭 Future Work

- Explore **cooperative game frameworks**
- Study **Stackelberg equilibria** between leaders and followers
- Apply models to multi-species or spatially distributed fisheries
